I have based my research on the UK’s [Department for Transport](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-transport) data. I investigated and found patterns and trends in Road Safety in various Local Authorities across the country.

Analysing over 350k rows of data, I saw patterns of how likely and when road accidents happened; from time of the day to weather patterns; from road types, road surface conditions to speed limits.

An interesting point was the reasonably sharp increase in accident numbers in February 2020, right after the lockdown restrictions were lifted.

## Defining the Question

What were the critical factors involved in the road casualties increase in the UK between 2020 and 2021?

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### Primary KPIs

* The total number of casualties from Jan 2021 to Dec 2022 in the United Kingdom
    
* Breakdown Total Casualties into categories Fatal, Serious, and Slight categories
    
* Display quantities and the percentual representation of each category
    

### Secondary KPIs

* Break down casualty numbers into subcategories such as vehicle type, speed limits, road types, road surface conditions, time of the day, and urban or rural areas.
    
* Display monthly trends comparing numbers from 2021 and 2022
    

## Collecting Data

I have looked at different resources to gather the data I needed to help me answer my proposed question. Two critical criteria were always on my mind: the data must be reliable and accurate.

I downloaded the data from The UK’s Department for Transport [Custom Data Download](https://roadtraffic.dft.gov.uk/custom-downloads/road-accidents) tool. Due to restrictions on the number of items to be selected at one time, five at most, I had to download three ODS (OpenData Spreadsheet) files and combine them into a single Excel workbook.

## Cleaning the Data

Cleaning the data was very straightforward since it came from an official government source. I still double-checked the data for possible spelling mistakes and row duplication.

I decided to remove columns I felt were irrelevant to my analysis as info on the “Local Police Authority” or the “Level of Economic Development” of the regions.

I have broken down the “Accident\_Date” column into “Month” and “Year” columns to use them to filter data.

## Analysing the Data

I have heavily used Pivot Tables to help separate into subcategories and focus on one aspect of the data at a time. I used specific values and rows to calculate, for example, the percental representation of casualties by seriousness and the kind of vehicles involved, as displayed below.

## Presenting the Data

After analysing various aspects of the data, I designed a Dashboard to present my findings and make the data visualisation easier to understand.

One of the jobs of a Data Analyst is to present the data in an understandable format. The choice of a colour pallet is crucial.

Since my analysis findings represented figures related to casualties, I used a more neutral colour pallet for my dashboard.

## The Dashboard

As a result of the data analysis performed, I created the dashboard visualisation below:

## The Insight Gathered

Out of the over 350k rows of data in the dataset, a pattern emerged on the regular increase of road casualties starting from the warmer months of the year, May until November, with a drop in numbers from December to February. There was a specific sharp increase in numbers in February 2020, the time when the Covid-19 Pandemic lockdown restrictions were lifted.

Almost three-quarters of accidents occurred during daytime; and over two-thirds in dry road conditions. There is roughly a 5:1 ratio between Single Carriageway and Dual Carriageway incidents; a significant amount of casualties happened at about 30mph.

Considering that many Local Authorities have set a 20mph speed limit in many urban zone roads, occurrences of serious and fatal casualties will likely decrease.

Investment in more visually adequate night-time signalling and night driving awareness campaigns should also help decrease the number of night-time accidents.
