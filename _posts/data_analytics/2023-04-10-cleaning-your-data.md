A very instructive Microsoft article on "[*Top ten ways to clean your data*](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/top-ten-ways-to-clean-your-data-2844b620-677c-47a7-ac3e-c2e157d1db19)" found by my colleague Bryan, from our [Cambridge Spark](https://www.cambridgespark.com/) Data Citizen Bootcamp. We have just finished Week 4 but we are already doing great things with Excel spreadsheets and Datasets.  
  
I can't wait to start using Python, PowerBI, Tableau, and more!  
  
Enjoy! ðŸ˜‰
