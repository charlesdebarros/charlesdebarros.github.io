This week, **Week 9** of our ***Data Citizen Bootcamp*** at [Cambridge Spark](https://www.cambridgespark.com/), was a gentle intro to Python for Data Analysis, including an intro to the Pandas data analysis library. As a Ruby developer, I have always found it fascinating to learn how other programming languages do similar things; Python is a joy to work with and very easy to learn.  
  
As always, after the lecture, I go online in search of complementary material to what I had learned. I found a very nice article called "[A Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Data Analysis in Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-beginners-guide-to-data-analysis-in-python-188706df5447)" written by [Natassha Selvaraj](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAACpndRgBndvraaM8lKG1Y1yoTiMd9nUXS04). It is a very well-written article with plenty of examples to follow through. Most definitely worth a read.  
  
Enjoy! ðŸ˜‰
