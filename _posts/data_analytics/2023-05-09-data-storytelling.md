Today we started Week 8 of our Data Citizen Bootcamp at [Cambridge Spark](https://www.cambridgespark.com/) and it was all about Data Storytelling. Finally, we are wrapping up all the last 7 weeks together. Tomorrow we have an end-to-end project day. I am very excited to be able to use everything we have learned since Week 1.  
  
Meanwhile, I have found a very interesting and useful article on [Data Storytelling](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/data-storytelling) from the Harvard Business School. A very good complementation to our session today.  
  
I hope this [article](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/data-storytelling) is also useful to other Data Analytics Trainees. Enjoy!
