It is Week 10, our last week, at the [Cambridge Spark](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlesdebarros/recent-activity/all/#) Data Citizen Bootcamp. It is also project week. We are putting to practice all the new skills we have learned in the past nine weeks. We have learned so much and are very proud of ourselves.

While reviewing some of the early course material, I found an interesting article on [Data Cleaning](https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/what-is-data-cleaning) in preparation for working with data. It is an article from the Tableau website easily be appliable to Power BI or Excel.

I hope it is helpful.

Enjoy! ðŸ˜‰
