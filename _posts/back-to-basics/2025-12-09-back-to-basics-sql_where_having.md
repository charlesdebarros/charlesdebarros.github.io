# SQL Filtering with WHERE and HAVING  
*(With diagrams, illustrations, and extra challenges)*

## Overview
This article explores how SQL filters data using **WHERE** and **HAVING**, how aggregation works, and when to use each clause. It also includes diagrams, examples, and practice challenges.

---

#  Understanding WHERE

## What WHERE Does  
The **WHERE** clause filters individual rows *before* any grouping or aggregation happens.

### Diagram: WHERE in Query Flow
```
Raw Table Rows
      |
      v
 +-----------+
 |  WHERE    |  <-- filters rows BEFORE grouping
 +-----------+
      |
      v
(Filtered Rows)
```

### Example
```sql
SELECT product_name, price
FROM products
WHERE price > 300;
```

---

#  What Is Aggregation?

Aggregation combines multiple rows into summary values (SUM, COUNT, AVG, etc.).

### Diagram: Aggregation Flow
```
Filtered Rows
      |
      v
 +-------------+
 |  GROUP BY   |
 +-------------+
      |
      v
Aggregated Results
```

---

#  HAVING Filters Aggregated Groups

WHERE cannot filter aggregated values. That’s where **HAVING** comes in.

### Diagram: HAVING in Query Flow
```
Raw Rows
   |
   v
 +--------+
 | WHERE  |
 +--------+
   |
   v
Filtered Rows
   |
   v
 +-----------+
 | GROUP BY  |
 +-----------+
   |
   v
Aggregated Rows
   |
   v
 +--------+
 | HAVING |  <-- filters AFTER aggregation
 +--------+
```

### Example
```sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total_spent
FROM sales
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING SUM(amount) > 150;
```

#  WHERE vs HAVING

### Illustration: What Each Clause Can Filter
```
            +------------------------------------+
            |           WHERE CLAUSE             |
            |------------------------------------|
            | Filters single rows                 |
            | Cannot use aggregates               |
            | Runs BEFORE group-by                |
            +------------------------------------+

            +------------------------------------+
            |           HAVING CLAUSE            |
            |------------------------------------|
            | Filters aggregated data             |
            | Uses COUNT, SUM, etc                |
            | Runs AFTER group-by                 |
            +------------------------------------+
```

#  When to Use Each Clause

| Situation | Use WHERE | Use HAVING |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Filter rows by raw values | ✔ | ❌ |
| Filter groups by aggregated values | ❌ | ✔ |
| Exclude unnecessary rows early | ✔ | ❌ |
| Filter based on COUNT(), SUM() | ❌ | ✔ |

#  Practice Challenges

## Challenge 1  
**Table:** `orders(customer_id, order_amount, status)`  
**Task:** Show customers who:  
1. Only consider orders with status = 'Completed'  
2. Have more than 3 completed orders  
3. Spent more than £500 in total  

### Solution
```sql
SELECT customer_id,
       COUNT(*) AS num_orders,
       SUM(order_amount) AS total_spent
FROM orders
WHERE status = 'Completed'
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 3
   AND SUM(order_amount) > 500;
```

---

## Challenge 2  
**Table:** `products(category, price)`  
**Task:** List categories whose **average** product price is between £200 and £500.

### Solution
```sql
SELECT category, AVG(price) AS avg_price
FROM products
GROUP BY category
HAVING AVG(price) BETWEEN 200 AND 500;
```

---

## Challenge 3  
**Table:** `sales(store, amount, date)`  
**Task:** Show stores that had at least **10 sales above £50** in the month of January.

### Solution
```sql
SELECT store,
       COUNT(*) AS count_sales
FROM sales
WHERE amount > 50
  AND date BETWEEN '2025-01-01' AND '2025-01-31'
GROUP BY store
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10;
```
