I cannot express enough how much this certificate means to me: it marks the end of an era and the beginning of a new one.

I started my Data Analyst journey last March with a heart filled with expectations and hoping for a career change. Leaving Web Development behind, especially the Ruby community, was tough as I have met many incredible people. I needed to turn a page and start writing a new one; that is what I did.

From a novice Data Analyst with a bare minimum knowledge of the field to learning to source, clean, analyse, and visualise data through exploring advanced Excel possibilities, Power Query, and Power BI. Learning to work with Python (Pandas and Numpy included), advancing my SQL skills, to name just a few, made me a better professional. I am excited to see what the future holds. I feel incredibly powerful, and that feels amazing.

The next step is, you guessed it, to find a job in a great place where I can learn to solidify and expand my recently acquired skills, picking up new ones. A place where I can collaborate and flourish.

I wish to take the opportunity to thank the fabulous [Cambridge Spark](https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https://www.credential.net/fba00166-3981-4112-b58c-f2c4649602fb#) team for everything they have done for me and my cohort; you rock big time.

You are all stars of the greatest magnitude.

I would also like to thank all my cohort colleagues; you have been the best and most friendly bunch ever. I am sure you will all be successful in your Data careers.

And finally, in the best fashion in the tech industry, whenever one learns a new programming language:

Hello, world! Here I come!
