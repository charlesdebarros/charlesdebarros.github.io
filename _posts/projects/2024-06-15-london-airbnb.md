### Initial considerations
The data used for the analysis comes from a dataset from 2019, pre-COVID-19 pandemic consequences. The first COVID-19 case was only detected on the 12th of February 2020.  
There are 83850 rows of data ranging from property name/description to price and availability.
Airbnb is present in all 33 London Boroughs.  

<br>

### On Neighbourhoods

Out of the 33 London Boroughs, the most expensive borough to rent an Airbnb property, with rental prices of almost £15k, was Westmister, followed by Haringey, Hackney, Wandsworth and Merton.

The most affordable neighbourhood was Richmond-upon-Thames. Followed by Barking and Dagenham, Kingston-upon-Thames, Enfield, and the City of London.

An intereting fact is that the most expensive neighbourhood, Westminster, and one of the most affordable, the City of London, are close to each other. Both at the heart of London.

### On room types

The most commonly available rental option in London is the _entire home/flat_, with almost 5000 locations available. _Private rooms_ are the second most available, a little short of 5000 locations. _Shared room_ rentals are the least available option.
