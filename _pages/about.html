I am an experienced Ruby on Rails web developer with experience in SQL/PostgreSQL databases, Python and JavaScript. I enjoy experimenting with new technologies and strive to learn something new daily.</p>

        <p>I am highly motivated, like to take the initiative, and my thirst for learning new things is my daily motivation. I would relish the opportunity to work with Data Analysis and expand my skills in the Data Analytics field. I am always looking for great mentors and outstanding managers.</p>

        <p>I'm a huge fan of computer Open-Source applications, such as Linux OS (Fedora and Ubuntu). I am a puzzles, challenges, and problem-solving activities enthusiast. I have a very active mind always looking for new things to learn on edX, Udemy, and Coursera.</p>

I once presented a talk at the NADDI 2019 conference in Ottawa, Canada, with a colleague representing the CLOSER project from UCL â€“ University College London. I like languages, having a native level in both Brazilian Portuguese and English. I can find my way around in French. I am also an adventurous baker.</p>
